## Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969–1980)
### Overview
The Vienna Convention codifies the rules for conclusion, interpretation, amendment and termination of treaties between States. In Ecuador v. Mexico, the Convention supplies the legal methodology for interpreting the asylum, diplomatic and anti‑corruption treaties Mexico invokes or is alleged to have breached and for assessing whether Mexico’s acts are compatible with those treaty obligations.
### Key Points
- Article 31 (good‑faith interpretation in context and in light of object and purpose) is central to construing the asylum, diplomatic and anti‑corruption treaties at issue
- Article 18 (obligation not to defeat a treaty’s object and purpose) and Article 26 (pacta sunt servanda) support Ecuador’s claim that Mexico must perform treaty obligations in good faith and cannot use diplomatic premises to frustrate enforcement
- Articles 34–36 govern when treaty provisions affect third States and are relevant to whether anti‑corruption and asylum rules create direct obligations between Ecuador and Mexico
- Article 30 helps resolve conflicts among overlapping treaties (e.g., Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations vs. regional asylum conventions); Article 60 provides the framework for legal consequences of material breach
- Articles 65–67 describe the required notification and dispute settlement procedures and support Ecuador’s use of the Court to resolve treaty interpretation and application disputes

## Responsibility Of States For Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001)
### Overview
The International Law Commission’s ARSIWA (2001) sets the legal framework for state responsibility: when state conduct is attributable and breaches an international obligation, the State incurs responsibility and must cease the act and make reparation. It identifies rules on attribution, breaches, circumstances precluding wrongfulness, and legal consequences (cessation, guarantees of non-repetition, restitution, compensation, and satisfaction).
### Key Points
- ARSIWA requires attribution plus breach: Mexico’s embassy acts and official pronouncements are attributable state conduct and can be shown to breach VCDR Article 41 and asylum conventions
- ARSIWA’s narrow defenses (consent, necessity, distress, force majeure) are unlikely to preclude wrongfulness here; Mexico’s political asylum claim does not meet those strict conditions
- Legal consequences under ARSIWA: Ecuador can seek cessation, guarantees of non-repetition, restitution/compensation and satisfaction for injury to its sovereignty and judicial order
- ARSIWA Articles 42–44 confirm Ecuador’s standing as an injured State and validate Ecuador’s diplomatic notices and claims prior to invoking the Court’s jurisdiction
- If Ecuador contemplates countermeasures ARSIWA limits require proportionality, prior demand/negotiation, and respect for peremptory norms and diplomatic inviolability

## Treaty Of Peace, Friendship, Commerce, And Navigation (1888)
### Overview
An 1888 treaty on peace, friendship, commerce and navigation reflects 19th‑century state practice on diplomatic relations, treatment of foreigners, and limits on the use of diplomatic premises. In the Ecuador v. Mexico context, it can be offered as historical evidence of customary rules on asylum, non‑intervention, and proper uses of missions.
### Key Points
- Historical evidence of limits on diplomatic asylum and the idea that legations should not shield persons convicted of ordinary crimes
- Supports the proposition that diplomatic premises must be used only for legitimate mission functions and not to obstruct local criminal justice
- Can be used to show long‑standing State practice and opinio juris relevant to customary rules on non‑intervention and respect for territorial sovereignty
- Probative value is cumulative: most persuasive when combined with regional asylum conventions, Vienna Convention norms, and subsequent State practice
- Defendant may challenge its direct relevance; treat as corroborative historical material rather than a binding modern multilateral source between Ecuador and Mexico

## Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic Of The Congo v. Belgium) (2002)
### Overview
The ICJ held that issuing and internationally circulating an arrest warrant for an incumbent foreign minister violated that minister’s immunity from criminal jurisdiction and inviolability under customary international law, and ordered Belgium to cancel the warrant and notify authorities to whom it had been circulated. The Court framed its reasoning around the functional purpose of immunities, limits on extraterritorial enforcement of domestic criminal law, and appropriate remedies for state-to-state injury.
### Key Points
- Affirmation of customary-law immunity and inviolability for incumbent foreign ministers from foreign criminal jurisdiction, grounded in functional necessity to perform state duties
- Issuing and internationally circulating an arrest warrant against an incumbent foreign minister violated the receiving State’s obligation to respect inviolability and engaged international responsibility; Court ordered cancellation of the warrant
- Court distinguished the questions of (i) national courts’ jurisdiction (including universal jurisdiction) and (ii) immunity — jurisdictional expansion does not by itself negate immunity
- The Court will fashion remedies against unlawful state acts between States (including requiring cancellation/recall of unlawful instruments) even where individual criminal accountability remains a separate issue
- The judgment highlights the Court’s methodology: reliance on treaty guidance, state practice and opinio juris, and careful treatment of competing values (immunity vs accountability) — with separate opinions underscoring unresolved tensions and limits of the ruling

## Julian Assange Ecuadorian Embassy Matter (2012–2019)
### Overview
Julian Assange sought and received diplomatic asylum in the Embassy of Ecuador in London (2012–2019), creating a prolonged clash between embassy inviolability under the Vienna Convention and the host State’s obligations to arrest and extradite. The episode exposed legal limits of diplomatic asylum and practical tensions when a receiving State refuses to recognize or facilitate diplomatic asylum.
### Key Points
- Embassy inviolability shelters individuals inside mission premises but does not automatically legalize shielding a local national from lawful arrest or prosecution
- Diplomatic asylum lacks universal binding force where the receiving State does not accept it; unilateral grants cannot override the receiving State’s criminal-justice obligations
- Using embassy premises to prevent enforcement of domestic criminal judgments can amount to misuse of a mission and interference with the receiving State’s sovereignty under Article 41 VCDR
- The Assange case demonstrates practical remedies and responses (persona non grata declarations, domestic statutory measures to withdraw premises recognition, or diplomatic rupture) that a receiving State may employ when mission inviolability is abused
- Assange provides persuasive analogy supporting Ecuador’s contention that Mexico’s conduct toward Jorge Glas exceeded lawful diplomatic functions and cannot be justified solely by inviolability or claims of asylum

## Border and Transborder Armed Actions (Nicaragua v. Honduras) (1988)
### Overview
The ICJ held that it had jurisdiction and that Nicaragua's application was admissible under Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá, treating that Article as an autonomous basis for compulsory jurisdiction and examining admissibility obstacles including prior regional procedures. The Court also addressed requirements for conciliation and when an ongoing regional process bars recourse to the Court.
### Key Points
- Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá is an independent, treaty-based basis for compulsory ICJ jurisdiction between Pact parties and is not superseded by unilateral declarations under Article 36 of the Statute
- Conciliation under Article XXXII is not necessarily a prerequisite to judicial seisin under Article XXXI; the two articles are autonomous routes to the Court
- An application is admissible even if linked to broader regional/political problems so long as it meets the Statute and Rules requirements and is sufficiently particularized
- A prior regional pacific procedure bars Court access only while it is continuing; a process that has come to a standstill is effectively ‘concluded’ for Article IV purposes

## Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission - Partial Award: Jus Ad Bellum (2005)
### Overview
The Eritrea‑Ethiopia Claims Commission (Partial Award, Jus ad Bellum) found Eritrea internationally liable for an unlawful resort to force in May 1998 (attack and occupation of Badme and nearby territory) and set principles on when use of force and claims of self‑defence are lawful. The Commission also addressed limits on what factual findings a tribunal may resolve and the distinction between origins of a conflict and legality of the resort to force.
### Key Points
- Affirms that unilateral derogations from a State’s territorial sovereignty require a clear legal basis; disputed claims do not justify breaking fundamental rules (analogy: misuse of diplomatic premises cannot be justified by asserted asylum)
- Establishes that limited or localized incidents do not automatically confer a right of self‑defence — tribunals must assess scale and character of the act (useful to show Mexico’s acts are not lawful exceptions to Ecuador’s sovereignty)
- Distinguishes factual origin inquiries from legal adjudication of wrongdoing; emphasizes the need for proof of legal character of State conduct (Ecuador should focus on proving legal elements of intervention and misuse of diplomatic premises)
- Reinforces that procedural irregularities (failure to use diplomatic channels, press declarations) and obstructing a receiving State’s law‑enforcement can be relevant indicia of unlawful interference
- Demonstrates tribunal practice in attributing international responsibility for violations of core principles (sovereign equality, territorial integrity, non‑intervention) which Ecuador can analogize to Mexico’s sheltering and removal efforts

## Gabcíkovo-Nagymaros Project (1997)
### Overview
The ICJ held that Hungary unlawfully suspended and abandoned parts of the 1977 treaty project, that Czechoslovakia/Slovakia exceeded its rights by putting a unilateral provisional solution into operation, and that the 1977 Treaty remained in force with continuing obligations and compensation consequences. The Court directed the parties to negotiate in good faith, take account of evolving environmental norms, and settle damages and operational arrangements in accordance with the treaty.
### Key Points
- Unilateral suspension/termination of treaty obligations is not lawful absent narrowly defined legal grounds; treaty continues to bind successor States
- A State may take preparatory measures, but putting a unilateral alternative regime into operation can be an internationally wrongful act if it exceeds treaty rights and is disproportionate
- States must negotiate in good faith to implement treaty objectives; evolving norms (e.g. environmental law) are relevant to treaty implementation and can be incorporated by agreement
- Where both parties commit intersecting wrongful acts, the Court may require compensation but encourage negotiated overall settlements (including offsetting claims)
- Countermeasures or unilateral measures must meet strict necessity and proportionality tests; premature or disproportionate unilateral action is condemned and gives rise to responsibility

## Convention on Political Asylum (1933)
### Overview
Regional treaty (Montevideo, 1933) that limits diplomatic/political asylum by prohibiting asylum in legations, warships, military camps or airships for persons accused or convicted of "common offenses" and requiring their surrender to local authorities. It clarifies that the granting State judges the political character of the offence but imposes an obligation to surrender where the offence is common.
### Key Points
- Article 1 prohibits granting asylum in legations/warships/military camps/airships to persons accused or convicted of common offences and requires surrender upon request by the local government
- Article 2 allocates to the asylum‑granting State the judgment of whether an offence is political, but does not negate Article 1’s surrender duty for common crimes
- The Convention is a regional treaty directly relevant to diplomatic asylum and supports Ecuador’s claim that Mexico unlawfully used its embassy to shield a convict from local criminal jurisdiction
- In the case at bar the Convention can be used alongside the Caracas Convention and VCDR Article 41 to show treaty‑based obligations breached and to rebut any lawful basis for Mexico’s announced asylum
- Limitations: State discretion under Article 2 to characterize offences politically and the need to show both Parties’ treaty obligations remain in force and applicable in the present dispute

## Agreement On Extradition Between The United States Of America And The European Union (2003–2010)
### Overview
A multilateral agreement between the United States and the European Union (and its Member States) that standardizes and enhances procedures for extradition cooperation, including definitions of extraditable offences, channels for requests and provisional arrest, transit, temporary surrender and treatment of sensitive information. It supplements and, in specified respects, replaces aspects of existing bilateral extradition treaties between the United States and EU Member States.
### Key Points
- Creates a clear, uniform threshold and definitions for extraditable offences (Art. 4) that reduce dual‑criminality friction and allow cooperation despite differences in domestic offense categories
- Facilitates rapid operational cooperation: direct provisional arrest requests, use of Interpol, embassy transmission to preserve detention time‑limits, and direct Ministry‑to‑Ministry exchanges for supplementary information (Arts. 5–8)
- Provides mechanisms for temporary surrender and transit that permit requested States to balance law‑enforcement interests with protections for detained persons (Arts. 9–12), and safeguards (capital‑punishment conditions, protection of sensitive information) to respect human‑rights and sovereign constraints (Arts. 13–14)
- Respects and complements bilateral treaties (Art. 3) and preserves requested States’ non‑derogable domestic grounds for refusal and the need for consultations where constitutional or judicial constraints arise (Art. 17)

## Vienna Convention On Diplomatic Relations (1961-1964)
### Overview
The Vienna Convention (1961) codifies the rules governing diplomatic missions, immunities, inviolability of mission premises, and the duties of diplomatic agents and sending States. It balances privileges necessary for mission functions with obligations to respect the laws and sovereignty of the receiving State.
### Key Points
- Article 22 inviolability of mission premises does not permit using those premises to obstruct local criminal justice; the receiving State must also protect against misuse
- Article 41(1) expressly requires persons enjoying diplomatic privileges to respect the laws of the receiving State and not to interfere in its internal affairs — central to Ecuador's claim that Mexico's actions were improper
- Diplomatic immunities protect accredited agents and specified staff, not private local nationals; sheltering a convicted local national to evade arrest falls outside the Convention's protective scope
- Procedural and remedial provisions (Article 9 persona non grata; Articles 45–46 on protection/entrustment when relations break off) offer lawful responses to misuse of a mission and are consistent with Ecuador’s diplomatic steps
- The Convention’s balance between privileges and obligations supports Ecuador’s argument that any derogation from another State’s sovereignty (e.g., effective removal of a person from jurisdiction) must have a clear legal basis and cannot be achieved by unilateral misuse of mission premises

## Convention On International Civil Aviation (1944-1948)
### Overview
The Chicago Convention establishes sovereignty of States over their airspace and a framework of rules for international civil aviation, including limits on state aircraft, rights of transit and landing, and obligations to respect domestic aviation laws. While primarily an air-transport instrument, several provisions bear on forcible or unauthorized removal of persons by air and on the use of aircraft in ways that affect a receiving State’s sovereignty and public order.
### Key Points
- Affirms State sovereignty over airspace (Art. 1) — unauthorized removal by air implicates sovereignty and entry/exit controls
- Distinguishes state and civil aircraft; state aircraft require authorization to enter/land in another State (Art. 3(c))
- Prohibits misuse of civil aviation for purposes inconsistent with Convention aims (Art. 4) — supports objections to unauthorized extrication by air
- Requires compliance with national laws on admission, clearance, immigration and customs for aircraft entering territory (Arts. 10–13, 22–24)
- Works as a complementary legal basis to show that any planned or attempted air removal of Mr. Glas by Mexico would have required Ecuador’s consent and thus could constitute a violation of Ecuador’s sovereignty

## Charter Of The Organization Of American States (1948 (amended 1967–1993))
### Overview
The OAS Charter establishes principles and organs for inter‑American cooperation, including respect for sovereign equality, non‑intervention, peaceful settlement of disputes, and promotion of representative democracy. In Ecuador v. Mexico these provisions support Ecuador’s claims that Mexico unlawfully interfered in Ecuador’s internal affairs and violated obligations to respect Ecuador’s sovereignty and legal order.
### Key Points
- Articles 1–3 and 10–19 affirm sovereign equality, territorial integrity, and a strict prohibition on intervention in the internal affairs of other Member States, directly supporting Ecuador’s non‑intervention claims.
- Articles 24–29 and Chapters IX–XIII provide for peaceful settlement mechanisms and empower OAS organs (Permanent Council, General Assembly) to assist disputes — supporting Ecuador’s right to seek regional and judicial remedies.
- The Charter’s emphasis on representative democracy and respect for legal processes (Articles 2(b), 3(d), 45) reinforces Ecuador’s claim that obstruction of its judicial system undermines obligations among Member States.
- Provisions on duties of States to respect one another’s rights and laws (Articles 11, 13, 19) can be cited to show Mexico’s embassy conduct and asylum decision derogated from Ecuador’s jurisdiction and legal order.
- Although not a source of ICJ jurisdiction, the Charter supplies regional norms and expectations that the Court may consider when evaluating whether Mexico breached obligations of non‑interference and cooperation with Ecuador.

## Convention Against Torture (1984-1987)
### Overview
The Convention Against Torture (CAT) establishes State obligations to prevent torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, criminalize and prosecute such acts, provide remedies and ensure non-refoulement where there are substantial grounds to believe a person would face torture. Relevant provisions include obligations to prevent torture (Arts. 2, 10–13), non-refoulement (Art. 3), criminalisation and jurisdiction (Arts. 4–7), mutual assistance and extradition (Arts. 8–9), and prompt investigation and remedy (Arts. 12–14).
### Key Points
- Article 3 (non‑refoulement) is central: it permits refusal of transfer only where substantial grounds exist to believe the person would face torture — Mexico must prove such grounds to justify non‑surrender.
- Procedural duties (Art. 6) and mutual assistance/extradition provisions (Arts. 8–9) support Ecuador’s claim that Mexico should have cooperated and not obstructed enforcement of domestic criminal judgments.
- Prevention, investigation and remedy obligations (Arts. 2, 12–14) cut two ways: they require States to prevent and investigate torture but do not permit unilateral refuge that undermines another State’s jurisdiction absent a real risk.
- If Mexico invokes CAT defensively, the Court will assess objective evidence of risk, consultation/assurances offered, and whether Mexico followed CAT’s procedural obligations before denying surrender.
- Overall, CAT does not provide a blanket justification for using diplomatic premises to shield a convicted national; it requires concrete, credible evidence of torture risk and fulfilment of procedural and cooperative duties.

## Lopez Burgos v. Uruguay (1981)
### Overview
The Human Rights Committee found that Uruguay violated the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by abducting, detaining and subjecting Lopez Burgos to inhuman treatment and by failing to investigate; the Committee also addressed the reach of a State's obligations to persons outside its territory. The decision highlights State responsibility for acts of agents abroad and the duty to investigate and remedy rights violations.
### Key Points
- State responsibility for violations committed by its agents abroad and for effects produced outside its territory where conduct is attributable to the State
- Obligation to investigate credible allegations of torture and ill-treatment and to provide effective remedies; failure to do so constitutes a further breach
- Prohibition of torture (Article 7 ICCPR) is absolute and state denials or silence are insufficient in the face of substantiated allegations
- The decision is persuasive authority showing human-rights obligations can inform and constrain diplomatic and extraterritorial conduct

## United Nations Convention Against Corruption (2003-2004)
### Overview
The United Nations Convention against Corruption (Merida Convention) establishes comprehensive standards for prevention, criminalization, international cooperation, and asset recovery to combat corruption. Its provisions require States Parties to cooperate widely in investigations, mutual legal assistance, extradition and the return of proceeds of corruption.
### Key Points
- Merida Convention (UN Convention against Corruption) creates binding obligations of prevention, criminalization and wide mutual legal assistance between States Parties
- Articles 43–46 and 48 require the widest measure of cooperation in investigations, mutual legal assistance and extradition for corruption offences and prohibit refusal of assistance on grounds such as bank secrecy
- Articles 51–57 make asset recovery a fundamental principle and require States to identify, freeze, seize and return proceeds of corruption, supporting Ecuador’s claims that Mexico unlawfully impeded enforcement and possible recovery
- Article 31 (freezing/seizure/confiscation) and Article 52 (enhanced scrutiny of politically exposed persons) support interim preservation measures and show State obligations to prevent transfer or dissipation of corrupt proceeds
- Ecuador can argue that Mexico’s sheltering and removal of a convicted national frustrated treaty duties under the Merida Convention and cannot be justified by diplomatic or asylum claims when offences are ordinary corruption crimes

## United Nations Charter (1945)
### Overview
The UN Charter establishes fundamental principles of sovereign equality, non‑intervention, peaceful settlement of disputes, and the role of the International Court of Justice. These principles are directly relevant to Ecuador’s claims that Mexico interfered in its internal affairs and breached obligations under international law in the Glas Espinel matter.
### Key Points
- Charter Principles: Sovereign equality and non‑intervention (Article 2) support Ecuador’s claim that Mexico unlawfully interfered in its internal affairs by sheltering and seeking to remove a convicted national.
- Peaceful Settlement & ICJ Role: The Charter encourages peaceful dispute settlement and recognizes the ICJ as the principal judicial organ (Chapter VI and Article 92), reinforcing Ecuador’s choice to bring the dispute to the Court.
- Obligation To Comply: Articles 94–95 impose an obligation to comply with ICJ decisions and permit recourse to the Security Council if a State fails to perform its judgment, bolstering requests for binding remedies.
- Primacy & Cooperation: Article 103 (Charter primacy) and Articles 55–56 on cooperation support Ecuador’s argument that Charter norms prevail over conflicting treaty or unilateral acts and that States must cooperate in upholding rule‑of‑law obligations.
- Procedural & Substantive Support: The Charter both procedurally validates ICJ jurisdiction for interstate disputes over international law and substantively supplies general principles (non‑intervention, respect for territorial jurisdiction) to frame Mexico’s conduct as internationally wrongful.

## American Treaty On Pacific Settlement (Pact Of Bogotá) (1948)
### Overview
The Pact of Bogotá (1948) obliges American states to settle inter-state disputes by peaceful regional procedures and recognizes the ICJ’s compulsory jurisdiction for juridical disputes among American states. It sets out a hierarchy of peaceful means (negotiation, good offices, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement) and procedural rules for their application.
### Key Points
- Article XXXI provides compulsory ICJ jurisdiction for juridical disputes among American States, supporting Ecuador’s seisin of the Court.
- Article V and XXXIII allow the Court to decide preliminary questions of domestic jurisdiction, enabling adjudication on whether Mexico’s acts are justiciable international wrongs.
- Articles II–IV and XVI emphasize regional peaceful procedures and restraint from acts that impede conciliation, bolstering Ecuador’s claim that Mexico unlawfully interfered with Ecuador’s judicial process.
- Article VII limits diplomatic recourse that would circumvent domestic remedies, supporting Ecuador’s argument that sheltering a convicted national in an embassy and granting asylum was incompatible with obligations under regional instruments and domestic-judicial respect.

## Universal Declaration Of Human Rights (1948)
### Overview
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) sets out fundamental rights — including rights to a fair trial, protection from arbitrary arrest or exile, and the right to seek asylum subject to limits — which inform international legal principles. In Ecuador v. Mexico, the UDHR can be cited to support Ecuador’s arguments about protection of judicial processes, prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of liberty or exile, and limits on asylum for non-political/common crimes.
### Key Points
- UDHR affirms rights to liberty, security, fair trial, and remedies (Articles 3,8,9,10,11) — useful to argue Ecuador’s criminal process must be respected
- Article 14(2) limits asylum for non-political/common crimes — supports Ecuador’s contention that Mexico’s asylum decision was unlawful
- UDHR’s principles on dignity, rule of law and non-interference (Articles 1,2,21) strengthen Ecuador’s claim that shielding a convicted official undermines democratic institutions and sovereignty
- Though not a treaty, UDHR reflects customary norms and interpretive guidance that can reinforce treaty-based arguments (Vienna Convention, asylum Conventions, anti-corruption Conventions) in the ICJ

## Statute Of The International Court Of Justice (1945–2025)
### Overview
The Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) sets out the Court’s composition, jurisdiction, applicable law and procedure, including provisions on seisin, provisional measures, admissibility, and the sources of international law the Court must apply. Relevant Rules of Court supplement procedural articles of the Statute.
### Key Points
- Article 36 (jurisdiction): gives the Court power to decide treaty and international-law disputes; essential to Ecuador’s reliance on Pact of Bogotá and treaty claims
- Article 41 (provisional measures): empowers the Court to order measures to preserve rights and prevent removal or irreversible acts
- Article 38 (sources of law): authorizes application of Vienna Convention, Caracas/Montevideo asylum rules, UN/OAS Charter norms, and anti‑corruption conventions relied on by Ecuador
- Articles 40–44 (procedure): set out filing, notification, written and oral proceedings and support Ecuador’s procedural compliance and admissibility
- Article 31 (judge ad hoc) and Articles 59–60 (binding, final judgments): let Ecuador appoint an ad hoc judge and seek a final, enforceable determination of legal consequences

## Inter-American Convention Against Corruption (1996)
### Overview
Regional treaty obliging OAS Member States to prevent, detect, punish and cooperate in relation to corruption, including mutual legal assistance, extradition and measures regarding proceeds of corruption. Ecuador can invoke the Convention to argue that Mexico breached its cooperation duties by sheltering and attempting to remove an Ecuadorian national convicted or prosecuted for corruption.
### Key Points
- Article XIV requires States Parties to afford the widest measure of mutual assistance in investigations, prosecutions and related proceedings concerning corruption, supporting Ecuador’s claim that Mexico had a duty to cooperate with surrender or custody requests
- Article XIII treats corruption offenses as extraditable and allows the Convention to serve as a legal basis for extradition where no bilateral treaty exists, undercutting Mexico’s unilateral removal of Glas instead of coordinating transfer or prosecution
- Article XV obliges States to assist with identification, tracing and seizure of proceeds and to cooperate on measures that secure enforcement of corruption-related judgments and investigations
- Article IV–V and the Convention’s Preamble emphasize applicability where acts were committed or produced effects in a State Party and the corresponding jurisdictional duties, reinforcing Ecuador’s position that the Convention governs cross-border cooperation here
- The Convention’s preventive and criminalization obligations (Articles VI–XI) contextualize Ecuador’s enforcement as part of a regional anti-corruption framework, showing Mexico’s actions frustrated multilateral anti-corruption objectives and specific cooperation duties

## Convention On Political Asylum (1933)
### Overview
The Convention on Political Asylum (Montevideo Convention, 1933) prohibits granting asylum in diplomatic premises to persons accused or convicted of common crimes and requires their surrender to local authorities on request. It frames asylum as a humanitarian, non‑reciprocal institution and reserves the assessment of political delinquency to the granting State.
### Key Points
- Article 1 bars asylum in diplomatic premises for persons accused or convicted of common offences and requires surrender on request by the local government
- Article 2 confirms that the State offering asylum judges political character, but regional practice and ICJ jurisprudence impose a strict test for political offences
- Article 3 treats political asylum as humanitarian and non‑reciprocal, but does not override obligations of the asylum State to respect the receiving State’s legal order regarding ordinary crimes
- Works with later regional instruments (e.g., Caracas Convention) that similarly restrict diplomatic asylum for common crimes and require cooperation with local authorities
- Relevant jurisprudence (e.g., Asylum case) recognizes that diplomatic asylum withdraws a person from territorial jurisdiction and therefore must have a legal basis and meet high standards for political persecution

## Vienna Convention On Consular Relations (1963-1967)
### Overview
The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR) sets out the functions, privileges and immunities of consular posts and consular officers, including inviolability of consular premises, freedom of communication, and the duty of consular personnel to respect the laws of the receiving State. In the Ecuador v. Mexico dispute the VCCR is relevant as a closely related instrument that articulates norms (in particular the duty not to use mission premises incompatibly with official functions) that may be invoked by either party, even though the facts primarily concern a diplomatic mission rather than a consular post.
### Key Points
- VCCR governs consular posts but expresses principles (inviolability, functional limits on privileges, duty not to interfere) that reinforce claims under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations
- Article 31 (inviolability of premises) and Article 55 (duty to respect laws and not to interfere) can be used by Ecuador by analogy to show misuse of mission premises to obstruct justice
- VCCR shows privileges are functional and limited — useful to argue asylum cannot lawfully shield persons prosecuted for ordinary crimes and that use of a mission for such sheltering is internationally wrongful
- Mexico may invoke inviolability protections but cannot rely on VCCR alone because the facts concern a diplomatic mission; the VCCR is best used as corroborative, not primary, authority

## Convention On Asylum (1928–1929)
### Overview
Regional inter-American treaty limiting diplomatic asylum for persons accused or convicted of common crimes and requiring surrender to local authorities; it conditions any diplomatic asylum on urgency, temporariness, and respect for receiving-State laws. The Convention was relied on by Ecuador to argue Mexico’s grant of asylum to Jorge Glas was unlawful.
### Key Points
- The Convention forbids diplomatic asylum in legations for persons accused or convicted of common crimes and requires their surrender to local authorities, supporting Ecuador’s claim that Mexico acted unlawfully by sheltering Glas.
- Diplomatic asylum for political offenders is permissible only in urgent, strictly temporary circumstances with immediate notification to local authorities—procedural limits Mexico did not respect when it announced asylum and sought safe conduct.
- Where refuge occurs abroad surrender should follow extradition channels; Mexico’s refusal to cooperate undermines the Convention’s prescribed surrender mechanisms and strengthens Ecuador’s claim of non-cooperation.
- The Convention’s prohibition on acts contrary to public peace and its requirement that asylum not be a means to evade ordinary criminal jurisdiction bolster Ecuador’s arguments about interference with its judicial process and territorial sovereignty.
- Because the Convention does not displace earlier treaty obligations, Ecuador may combine Havana-based arguments with breaches of the Vienna Convention and anti-corruption conventions to show cumulative international responsibility by Mexico.

## International Covenant On Civil And Political Rights (1966-1976)
### Overview
The ICCPR binds States Parties to respect and ensure a wide range of civil and political rights for all persons within their territory and jurisdiction and to provide effective remedies when those rights are violated. Several provisions (notably Articles 2, 9, 14, 19 and 12) may be invoked to assess conduct that obstructs domestic criminal proceedings, arbitrary deprivation of liberty, and interference with legal guarantees.
### Key Points
- Article 2 and 2(3): States must respect and ensure Covenant rights and provide effective remedies—useful to show Mexico’s conduct impeded Ecuador’s ability to secure rights and remedies
- Article 9: protection against arbitrary deprivation of liberty and right to prompt judicial review — Mexico’s sheltering/removal of Glas interfered with lawful arrest and judicial processes
- Article 14: fair trial guarantees — shielding a convicted person and obstructing custody undermines Ecuador’s ability to implement criminal justice and secure trial rights
- Articles 41–42: interstate communication and conciliation procedures before the Human Rights Committee provide complementary accountability avenues, though ICCPR is primarily individual‑rights oriented
- Article 19 and Article 12: freedom of expression and freedom of movement offer subsidiary angles (statements by Mexico’s leadership and removal of a national) but require careful framing alongside Charter and diplomatic law on non‑intervention

## Temple Of Preah Vihear (1962)
### Overview
ICJ judgment finding that the Temple of Preah Vihear lay within Cambodian territory, applying treaty interpretation, map evidence and acquiescence to determine sovereignty and limiting the legal basis for diplomatic asylum as a derogation from territorial sovereignty. The Court ordered Thailand to withdraw forces and to return certain cultural property.
### Key Points
- Court gave decisive weight to contemporaneous official instruments and subsequent acquiescence in determining rights arising from treaties and maps
- Established that a grant of diplomatic asylum that removes a person from the territorial State's jurisdiction derogates from that State's sovereignty and requires a clear legal basis
- Affirmed that State conduct and failure to protest over time can create estoppel/acquiescence affecting territorial claims or the legal effect of instruments
- Supported remedies ordering withdrawal of forces from a foreign territory and return of removed cultural property when sovereignty and misuse were established
- Demonstrates the Court's willingness to examine diplomatic correspondence and practice to determine whether use of diplomatic premises was compatible with functions and treaty obligations

## Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic Of Iran V. United States) (1992-2003)
### Overview
ICJ judgment addressing whether U.S. attacks on Iranian offshore oil platforms (1987–1988) violated the 1955 Treaty of Amity, and whether the United States could rely on a treaty clause preserving measures to protect essential security interests (interpreted in light of the UN Charter and customary law on use of force). The Court rejected both Iran’s claim under Article X(1) and the U.S. counter-claim, and examined the interaction of treaty defenses with general international law.
### Key Points
- Treaty exceptions (e.g., security or asylum) are interpreted in light of general international law and cannot justify measures otherwise unlawful (Court applied UN Charter/self‑defence law to treaty clause)
- Claimant bears the burden to prove wrongful acts and attribution; the Court requires concrete evidence and will distinguish direct from indirect effects when assessing treaty rights
- Court enforces territorial and functional limits of treaty protections—uses of diplomatic premises incompatible with mission functions may violate other obligations
- Admissibility and scope of claims/counterclaims are tightly controlled; parties cannot expand the dispute’s subject to avoid legal limits or to seek remedies not pleaded
- Oil Platforms is useful to argue that treaty defenses or unilateral acts (press announcements, claimed asylum) do not override obligations of non‑intervention, territorial sovereignty, and cooperation in criminal matters

## S.S. Lotus (1927)
### Overview
The Permanent Court of International Justice held that, absent a prohibitive rule of international law, States remain free to exercise jurisdiction and sovereign powers, and that a State does not violate international law simply by exercising jurisdiction unless a specific rule forbids it.
### Key Points
- The Court held there was no universally accepted rule prohibiting a State from prosecuting a foreigner for acts that produced effects on its ship on the high seas; therefore Turkey's prosecution was not ipso facto contrary to international law.
- Fundamental proposition: absent an applicable treaty or prohibitive customary rule, States retain broad discretion to exercise jurisdiction; restrictions on that discretion must be proven.
- Lotus recognizes concurrent jurisdictions may arise (e.g., flag State and injured State) and rejects a rigid exclusive flag State rule in the facts before it.
- Dissents emphasized territoriality and the law-of-the-flag principle and warned against sanctioning unilateral extensions of domestic criminal law that impinge on other States' sovereignty.
- The decision is factual and limited in scope; it turned on the absence of a prohibitive customary rule applicable to collisions on the high seas rather than creating a general license for all extraterritorial acts.

## Rules Of Court (1978-2023)
### Overview
The ICJ Rules of Court set out the procedural framework for instituting and conducting contentious cases before the Court, including jurisdictional filings, written and oral proceedings, provisional measures, and incidental procedures. In Ecuador v. Mexico those Rules govern Ecuador’s application, the request for provisional measures, jurisdictional objections, evidence and pleadings, and any applications to intervene or for interpretation/revision.
### Key Points
- Article 38 requirements govern Ecuador’s Application content and signature/authentication formalities and the Registrar must transmit a certified copy to Mexico promptly, so Ecuador’s documentary record and diplomatic notes (annexes) are procedurally critical
- Articles 73–77 give priority and an expedited procedure for provisional measures — Ecuador’s request for urgent protection (e.g., to prevent removal of Mr. Glas) must be heard urgently and the President may convene the Court immediately
- Articles 44–53 control the written phase: time‑limits, required annexes, certified translations and limits on post‑written submissions — these rules shape Ecuador’s evidentiary disclosures and Mexico’s ability to lodge preliminary objections under Articles 79–79ter
- Articles 31, 35–37 and 40 regulate agents, counsel and judges ad hoc — Ecuador may exercise rights to appoint an agent and, if needed, select a judge ad hoc; Mexico’s choice or any request to abstain must follow prescribed timing
- Articles 81–86 and Article 43 enable third‑party participation or requests for observations from public international organizations (e.g., OAS) or States parties to asylum/anti‑corruption conventions, which Ecuador can invoke to show treaty interpretation and contextual support

## United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (Tehran Hostage Case) (1980)
### Overview
The ICJ found Iran internationally responsible for the seizure and prolonged detention of US diplomatic and consular staff in Tehran, ordered immediate release and restoration of mission premises to a protecting power, and held Iran liable to make reparation. The Court emphasized States' obligations under the Vienna Conventions and general international law to prevent use of diplomatic premises in a manner incompatible with their functions.
### Key Points
- Affirmed duty under Vienna Conventions to prevent use of mission premises in ways incompatible with mission functions and to respect laws of the receiving State
- State responsibility attaches where State organs endorse, perpetuate or approve sheltering that interferes with the receiving State’s jurisdiction
- Court ordered immediate remedies (release, safe passage, handing premises to a protecting power) and reserved reparations — directly applicable remedial template for Ecuador
- Diplomatic asylum does not permit derogation from territorial sovereignty to shield persons convicted of common crimes; lawful basis must be established case-by-case
- Court may proceed and rely on concordant documentary evidence even where the respondent State refuses to participate, and will examine jurisdiction and admissibility sua sponte

## Immunities and Criminal Proceedings (Equatorial Guinea v. France) (2016-2020)
### Overview
The ICJ decided whether a Paris property formed part of Equatorial Guinea’s diplomatic mission and therefore enjoyed inviolability under the Vienna Convention, holding that a receiving State’s timely, non-arbitrary and non-discriminatory objection can prevent a property from acquiring ‘premises of the mission’ status. The Court emphasised the object and purpose of the Vienna Convention and limited the scope of diplomatic protection where recognition would frustrate legitimate criminal justice processes.
### Key Points
- A receiving State can prevent a property from becoming ‘premises of the mission’ by communicating an objection that is timely, non-arbitrary and non-discriminatory; ownership alone is insufficient to create diplomatic premises.
- The Vienna Convention must be read in light of its object and purpose: diplomatic privileges exist to ensure functional performance of missions, not to shield individuals or obstruct the receiving State’s criminal justice.
- Recognition or protection of premises is not absolute where doing so would impede legitimate criminal investigations; State practice and context matter in assessing whether premises have acquired diplomatic status.
- The Court will consider diplomatic exchanges and the sequence of communications when assessing whether an objection was timely and reasonable.
- Provisional measures may be indicated to preserve inviolability temporarily, but they do not predetermine the merits of a claim that privileges were misused.

## Military And Paramilitary Activities In And Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States Of America) (1984-1986)
### Overview
The ICJ found the United States internationally responsible for unlawful intervention in Nicaragua through support for contra forces, direct attacks (including mining), and violations of Nicaraguan sovereignty and maritime commerce, and affirmed State responsibility and the duty to make reparation. The judgment elaborated core rules of customary international law on non‑intervention, sovereignty, use of force, and attribution of wrongful acts to States.
### Key Points
- Affirmation of non‑intervention and state sovereignty: supporting armed groups to coerce or overthrow another State constitutes wrongful intervention and may engage responsibility.
- Attribution and responsibility: a State can be held responsible for acts of irregular forces where it finances, organizes, trains, equips, directs or exercises effective control over their operations; certain direct acts (e.g., mining ports) were attributable to the United States.
- Non‑use of force and self‑defence limits: collective self‑defence is only lawful in response to an armed attack and must meet necessity and proportionality; provision of arms or support to rebels alone is not automatically an armed attack.
- Use of diplomatic/other facilities and abuse of functions: while the case focused on paramilitary support and direct force, the Court emphasized that conduct which interferes with another State's judicial or sovereign functions (or frustrates its territorial jurisdiction) can amount to unlawful intervention and give rise to responsibility.
- Procedural and evidentiary guidance: the Court addressed admissibility, justiciability and the treatment of evidence where the respondent does not participate, which is relevant when evaluating claims of wrongful State conduct and attribution.

## Minquiers And Ecrehos (1953)
### Overview
The ICJ decided (unanimously) that sovereignty over the Minquiers and Écréhous islands belonged to the United Kingdom, applying proof standards based on effective and continuous display of state authority rather than indirect medieval presumptions. The Court emphasized direct evidence of administration and acts manifesting sovereignty when resolving competing title claims.
### Key Points
- Burden of proof: each State must prove title by direct evidence of possession and sovereign acts rather than relying solely on indirect medieval presumptions or treaties that do not specify the territory
- Effective control standard: peaceful, continuous and public exercise of State functions (administration, justice, taxation, registry, policing, etc.) is decisive evidence of sovereignty
- Acts that are technical, sectoral or navigational (e.g., buoys, lights) are not necessarily manifestations of sovereignty unless clearly intended as State authority over the territory
- The Court will evaluate the probative value of a series of acts over time; isolated or equivocal acts by a State are insufficient to establish title
- Historical claims must be corroborated by later manifestations of authority — long-term local administration carries strong weight

## Convention On Diplomatic Asylum (Caracas Convention) (1954)
### Overview
Regional treaty establishing rules for diplomatic asylum in the Americas, including limits on asylum for persons charged with or convicted of common offences and procedures for safe-conduct and surrender. Relevant provisions clarify when diplomatic asylum may be granted and the duties of the asylum-granting State and the territorial State.
### Key Points
- Article III: asylum unlawful for persons under indictment, on trial, or convicted of common offences unless the acts are clearly political in nature — places the burden on the asylum-granting State to justify a political character.
- Articles V, XI–XIII: asylum is limited to urgent, temporary measures to secure safe departure and requires the territorial State to grant safe-conduct and guarantees to permit departure (except in case of force majeure).
- Article IX: asylum-granting State must consider information from the territorial State when determining the character of the offence; the decision to continue asylum or to request safe-conduct is respected but must take that information into account.
- Articles VIII and XVIII: the asylum-granting mission must notify the territorial authorities promptly and must not permit asylees to interfere in the internal politics or public peace of the territorial State.
- Mexico is a party to the Convention, so Ecuador can rely on its treaty obligations to challenge Mexico’s actions under the Convention in addition to other instruments (Vienna Convention, Montevideo Convention).

## Barcelona Traction, Light And Power Company, Limited (Belgium v. Spain) (1970)
### Overview
The ICJ held that Belgium lacked standing to espouse claims on behalf of shareholders in a Canadian company injured by measures taken in Spain, affirming that diplomatic protection of corporate injury belongs primarily to the State of the company's nationality. The Court dismissed Belgium’s claim for lack of jus standi (capacity to bring the claim).
### Key Points
- Core holding: only the State of a company’s nationality may espouse claims for injuries to the corporate entity; shareholder States lack jus standi to bring such claims
- Court distinguished corporate rights from individual shareholders’ rights and rejected equitable expansion of diplomatic protection to shareholder States
- Barcelona Traction provides a strong precedent to object to interstate claims that merely vindicate private or corporate rights rather than rights of the applicant State
- Ecuador v Mexico can be distinguished because Ecuador alleges breaches of inter‑state obligations (misuse of diplomatic premises, non‑intervention, treaty duties to cooperate on anti‑corruption), i.e., injuries to Ecuador’s sovereign rights rather than to a private person or foreign corporation
- Procedural lesson: frame the dispute as an injury to State rights and ground standing on treaties/customary law to avoid the bar applied in Barcelona Traction

## Convention Relating To The Status Of Refugees (1951-1967)
### Overview
The 1951 Convention (and its 1967 Protocol) defines who is a refugee and establishes core protections—most importantly non-refoulement and non-penalization—together with States’ duties on travel documents, rights and cooperation with UNHCR. In Ecuador v. Mexico, the Convention can be used to test whether Mr. Glas fell within the refugee definition and whether Mexico’s actions were a lawful exercise of asylum or an abuse incompatible with other international obligations.
### Key Points
- The Convention defines refugees narrowly (well‑founded fear for five protected grounds) and excludes serious non‑political criminals (Article 1F).
- Non‑refoulement protects those meeting the refugee definition but does not legitimize sheltering convicted common criminals or obstructing another State’s judicial enforcement.
- Article 31 (non‑penalization) and Articles 27–28 (identity and travel documents) presuppose lawful refugee status and do not validate diplomatic asylum in the face of disqualifying convictions.
- Article 35 requires cooperation with UNHCR and reflects that asylum must be applied consistent with international law; the 1967 Protocol universalized Convention coverage so the Convention’s tests apply to modern claims.
- Argument strategy: show Mr. Glas is not a Convention refugee (or falls under 1F), hence Mexico’s embassy shelter and press grant of asylum lack legal basis and cannot lawfully obstruct Ecuador’s criminal process.

## Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda) (2005-2022)
### Overview
The ICJ found Uganda internationally responsible for unlawful use of force, violations of humanitarian and human-rights law and looting of natural resources in the DRC (merits, 2005) and later quantified reparations (reparations phase, judgment 2022). The judgments set out principles on State responsibility, causal nexus, burden and standard of proof in mass-injury contexts and permissible forms of reparation.
### Key Points
- Where a State exercised occupation or effective control, the Court shifted evidentiary burdens and required the occupier to show a particular injury was not caused by its failure of vigilance
- The Court required a sufficiently direct and certain causal nexus for compensation but allowed flexible proof and reasonable estimation in mass-injury contexts
- Global lump-sum awards and equity infra legem are permissible in exceptional circumstances where precise quantification is impossible, but ex aequo et bono requires consent
- Findings about derogation from territorial sovereignty and diplomatic asylum in earlier jurisprudence (Asylum case) were endorsed and applied as principles relevant to interference in internal affairs
- The Court rejected claims lacking causal link or adequate evidence (illustrating limits: strong claims still require a demonstrable legal and factual connection)

## American Convention On Human Rights (1969)
### Overview
Regional human-rights treaty (Pact of San José) establishing civil, political, economic and social rights and creating the Inter‑American Commission and Court of Human Rights. It imposes positive obligations on States to respect and ensure rights (including due process, personal liberty and judicial protection) for all persons under their jurisdiction.
### Key Points
- Establishes State obligations to respect and ensure rights to all persons under their jurisdiction (Article 1(1)), including positive duties to enable effective judicial protection (Article 25).
- Protects personal liberty and fair‑trial guarantees (Articles 7 and 8) — Ecuador can argue Mexico’s sheltering of a convicted person interfered with these rights by preventing lawful arrest and enforcement of judgments.
- Affirms protections relevant to movement, exile/asylum limits and the rule of law (Article 22 and related principles) that undermine any abusive use of diplomatic premises to avoid prosecution for common crimes.
- Protects political participation and the integrity of democratic processes (Article 23); Ecuador can rely on this to show Mexico’s public statements about Ecuador’s elections constituted wrongful interference with democratic institutions.
- The Convention supplies a regional human‑rights lens showing how Mexico’s actions frustrated Ecuador’s duty to provide remedies and uphold the rule of law, supporting Ecuador’s claims of international responsibility even where asylum/diplomatic law overlap with human‑rights obligations.

## Alleged Violations Of Sovereign Rights And Maritime Spaces (Nicaragua v. Colombia) (2022)
### Overview
The Court found that Colombia breached Nicaragua’s sovereign rights in Nicaragua’s exclusive economic zone by interfering with fishing, authorising fishing and purporting to enforce conservation measures, and that Colombia’s ‘integral contiguous zone’ exceeded customary-law limits. The Judgment also addressed jurisdiction ratione temporis, admissibility and standards of proof.
### Key Points
- Jurisdiction Ratione Temporis: the Court may examine post‑lapse events that arise directly from the dispute and meet continuity/connexity criteria — relevant for claims based on continuing or linked conduct
- Standards Of Proof: applicant bears burden; contemporaneous/direct evidence is strongest; press reports and litigation‑prepared materials are treated with caution and need corroboration
- Sovereign Rights In Zones: coastal State rights in the EEZ (explore/exploit/conserve/manage) are protected; third States must have due regard and cannot lawfully exercise enforcement or conservation jurisdiction inconsistent with the coastal State’s rights
- Misuse Of Domestic Measures: unilateral domestic rules (e.g., creation/expansion of zones or broad control powers) that impinge on another State’s maritime rights can engage international responsibility and must be remedied
- Remedies: Court ordered cessation of wrongful acts and substantive adjustment of national measures (by the State’s own means); compensation requires demonstrable material injury

## Colombian-Peruvian Asylum Case (1950)
### Overview
The ICJ held that diplomatic asylum is a derogation from the territorial State’s sovereignty and cannot be unilaterally and definitively qualified by the State of refuge; asylum is lawful only where its treaty conditions (including political character and urgency) are met, and a safe‑conduct is not owed unless the territorial State has demanded the refugee’s departure. The Court rejected Colombia’s claim to a binding unilateral qualification and found the grant of asylum in the circumstances not in conformity with the Havana Convention.
### Key Points
- Diplomatic asylum derogates from territorial sovereignty and thus requires a legal basis in each case
- The State of refuge lacks a generally binding right to unilaterally and definitively qualify the nature of offences committed in the territorial State
- Asylum under regional conventions is limited to objectively established political offences and cases of genuine urgency — ordinary legal prosecution does not justify asylum
- The territorial State is not obliged to grant safe‑conduct unless it has been required to effect the refugee’s departure
- The judgment supports limiting extraterritorial use of mission premises where it would unlawfully interfere with the receiving State’s jurisdiction and administration of justice

## Rainbow Warrior (1990)
### Overview
Arbitral tribunal (France–New Zealand) found France breached obligations in an exchange‑of‑letters agreement after French agents were removed from a Pacific facility, addressed circumstances excluding wrongfulness (force majeure, distress, necessity), and ordered declaratory relief and moral satisfaction. The tribunal applied customary treaty and state responsibility principles to assess justification and remedies.
### Key Points
- Treaty obligations are assessed together with general rules of state responsibility; breaches give rise to responsibility even if characterized as implementation of agreements
- Circumstances excluding wrongfulness (force majeure, distress, necessity) are narrowly construed: force majeure requires impossibility; distress requires extreme, demonstrable urgency, good‑faith attempts to obtain consent, and restoration once the emergency ceases
- A State cannot rely on its domestic law as a justification for failing to perform international obligations
- Remedies include declarations of breach and satisfaction (including non‑material damage); orders for cessation may be inappropriate if the underlying obligation has expired
- Tribunal can recommend conciliatory measures (e.g., fund/contribution) as appropriate satisfaction
